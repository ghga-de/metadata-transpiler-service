          type: string
        key_type:
          description: A semantic type that characterizes the attribute key.             Usually
            this is a term from an ontology. For example, 'MAXO:0000616'             indicates
            that the attribute is a measurement of oxygen saturation in             the
            blood.

        value_type:
          description: The value type that characterizes the attribute value. Usually             this
            is a term from an ontology that describes how to interpret the             value.
            For example, 'SIO:001413' indicates that the value is to be             interpreted
            as a percentage.
